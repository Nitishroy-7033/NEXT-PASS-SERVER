# NextPass API Security Implementation

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

- JWT Bearer token authentication with proper validation
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints (5 requests/minute)
- Secure password hashing using BCrypt
- Authorization required for all sensitive endpoints

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization

- Email format validation
- Password strength requirements (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special char)
- Input length limits to prevent buffer overflow attacks
- Regex escaping to prevent injection attacks
- NoSQL injection prevention using MongoDB driver filters

### 3. Security Headers

- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- Server header removal

### 4. CORS Configuration

- Restricted to specific origins (not wildcard)
- Credentials allowed for authenticated requests
- Proper headers and methods allowed

### 5. Rate Limiting

- Authentication endpoints: 5 requests/minute
- General endpoints: 100 requests/minute
- Queue-based request handling

### 6. Encryption

- AES-256-CBC encryption for password storage
- Unique IV for each encryption operation
- Secure key generation using cryptographically secure RNG
- Base64 encoding for safe transport

### 7. Configuration Security

- Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Production configuration template
- No secrets in source code
- Different settings for development/production

### 8. Error Handling

- Generic error messages to prevent information disclosure
- Proper HTTP status codes
- No stack trace exposure in production

## Security Recommendations

### Environment Setup

1. Use the `.env.template` file to create your `.env` file
2. Generate strong, unique keys for each environment
3. Never commit `.env` files to version control
4. Use different database credentials for each environment

### Database Security

1. Use MongoDB connection with authentication
2. Implement proper user access controls in MongoDB
3. Enable MongoDB encryption at rest
4. Use connection string with SSL/TLS

### Production Deployment

1. Use HTTPS only (TLS 1.2+)
2. Implement proper firewall rules
3. Regular security updates and patches
4. Monitor for suspicious activities
5. Implement logging and alerting

### Key Rotation

1. Rotate JWT signing keys regularly
2. Rotate database credentials
3. Rotate encryption keys (requires data re-encryption)
4. Monitor for compromised credentials

### Monitoring & Logging

1. Log authentication attempts
2. Monitor rate limit violations
3. Alert on suspicious patterns
4. Regular security audits

## Additional Security Measures to Consider

1. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
2. **Account lockout after failed attempts**
3. **Session management and timeout**
4. **API versioning with deprecation policies**
5. **Content Security Policy (CSP) headers**
6. **Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing**
7. **Backup encryption and secure storage**
8. **Data anonymization and GDPR compliance**

## Security Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test rate limiting effectiveness
- [ ] Verify JWT token validation
- [ ] Check input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] Test CORS configuration
- [ ] Verify encryption/decryption functionality
- [ ] Test authentication bypass attempts
- [ ] Check for SQL/NoSQL injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] Verify error handling doesn't leak information
- [ ] Test with security scanning tools
- [ ] Verify HTTPS enforcement
